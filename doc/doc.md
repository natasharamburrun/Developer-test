Aim: Create an no interactive gallery where users can view and search through the shared items.

Data API: We have an API endpoint that returns the latest 100 shared items on Kano World
http://api.kano.me/share?limit=100


TOO DO:

1) Style: Add a header at the top of the page with the Kano logo and the page title ‘Latest 100 shares’

2) Top 100 shared items displayed in a grid-like format
Each share item should show a picture, title, author’s username and number of likes.
Add an index page with its own routes and controller

3) Add a Show page via route and component which shows the details of the items from the api data

4) Add a Search functionality  by title

5) Add sort functionality
