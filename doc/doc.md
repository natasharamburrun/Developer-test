Aim: Create an no interactive gallery where users can view and search through the shared items.

Data API: We have an API endpoint that returns the latest 100 shared items on Kano World
http://api.kano.me/share?limit=100

Style: A header at the top of the page with the Kano logo and the page title ‘Latest 100 shares’

1) Top 100 shared items displayed in a grid-like format

Each share item should show a picture, title, author’s username and number of likes.

2) Search by title
